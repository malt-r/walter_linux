This project is an archived repo from a university assignment at University of Applied Sciences Bielefeld 
from the "Mechatronische Systeme" course during the winter semester 2019/2020. 
This repo serves as an archival method for this project.

## Notes about the project

In the final semester of the study track 'mechatronics & automation', groups of 5 students could chose to plan, 
research and execute a project in the realm of mechatronics of their own choosing.
We aimed to create a walking [hexapod](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexapod_(robotics)) robot from scratch.
This repo holds the motion control software implemented from the ground up. It was running on a Raspberry Pi 3 
with a servo controller board connected via serial over USB.

Because of the massive time constraints, this project is probably riddled with bugs and questionable design choices.
