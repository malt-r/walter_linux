This project is an archived repo from a university assignment at University of Applied Sciences Bielefeld 
from the "Mechatronische Systeme" course during the winter semester 2019/2020. 

## Notes about the project

In the final semester of the study track 'mechatronics & automation', groups of students had to plan, 
research and execute a project in the realm of mechatronics and automation of their own choosing.

We aimed to create a walking [hexapod](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexapod_(robotics)) robot from scratch.
This repo holds the motion control software implemented from the ground up for this robot. 
It was running on a Raspberry Pi 3 with a servo controller board connected via serial over USB.

Because of the massive time constraints and my lack of knowledge in robotics and motion control (inverse kinematics ðŸ‘€), 
this project is probably riddled with bugs and questionable design choices. 

This repository is only intended for documentation purposes.

## Demo Video
